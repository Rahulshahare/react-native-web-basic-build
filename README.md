React Native For Web - Build multi-platform apps
------------------------------------------------
"React Native for Web" makes it possible to run React Native components and APIs on the web using React DOM.

Using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) it is possible to write the same React code for both React and React Native. It makes life much easier, itâ€™s a great approach for building multi-platform apps.
[Docs](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/)

Basically the setup is set in such a way that the app will have two entry points, one for React and anather for React-Native. Writing the code once and build for both is a idea, and the React-Native-Web is the the main source of magic in this app. This library will convert our react-native components into web elements.

There are bunch of tool with autoConfiguration like [expo](https://expo.io)
